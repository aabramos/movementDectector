Made in C ++ for educational purposes, this simple motion detector for Windows uses the OpenCV 2.1 and Winmm.lib libraries. 
The capture area should be well lit, and with static elements in the object area, otherwise the System will trigger the alarm.

When activated, the program has the following commands: "d" key is used to disable the alarm, "a" key is used to activate the alarm, 
and the "ESC" key is used to exit the program.
